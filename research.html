I currently work on
 modular forms, cusp forms, twisting, the
Rankin–Selberg method, the analytic computation of the constant term of non-holomorphic Eisenstein series,
local fields, adeles, p-adic integration, and the special functions that arise in explicit computations. 
 </p> 
 <p>  
I also
study the computation of all Fourier coefficients and encountered the Whittaker function in the big Bruhat
cell. To understand this construction more thoroughly, I studied the relevant representation-theoretic background, including degenerate principal series and the Schrödinger model of the Weil representation, following
Yang’s CM Number Fields and Modular Forms and Kudla–Yang’s Eisenstein Series for SL(2), which I am
currently reading in depth. These studies have shaped my current project on generalizing Whittaker function
constructions.

</p>  

<p>
 In Algebraic Topology I studied free resolutions using augmented chain complexes,
which gave me helpful intuition for homological tools that appear in the study of arithmetic groups.
</p>  
   
<p>
In Algebraic Geometry I explored the connection between the j-invariant and ring class fields, following portions of Gross–Zagier
and Cox.
</p> 
   
 <p> 
 In Matrix Analysis I studied the correspondence between ideal classes and similarity classes of matrices
through the Latimer–MacDuffee theorem, discovering a surprising link to class numbers.
 </p>  

 <p> 
In Summer 2023, I completed a Directed Reading Program on the Dirichlet Class Number Formula under the guidance of Gaurish Korpal. 
</p>    
   
<p>
   In Spring 2023, I worked on a project focused on application of category theory, under the supervision of Prof. Olcay Coskun. 
In this project we studied the Prof. Tom Leinster's paper called Entropy and Diversity: The Axiomatic Approach. 
Here I learned about how to grasp physical concepts like entropy in pure algebraic ways.
